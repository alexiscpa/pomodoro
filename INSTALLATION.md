# Quick Installation Guide

## Step 1: Generate Icons (Required)

The extension needs icon files to work. Choose one of these options:

### Option A: Auto-generate with Python (Recommended)
```bash
cd icons
python generate_icons.py
```

### Option B: Manual Creation
Create three PNG files in the `icons/` directory:
- `icon16.png` (16×16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48×48 pixels)
- `icon128.png` (128×128 pixels)

Use any image editor or online tool. A simple red circle works fine for testing.
